    <p>There are hundreds of thousands of typefaces available around the world. Each typeface has characteristics unique to the time when it was created. In this brief, our goal was to successfully represent our chosen typeface and its qualities. Allow me to introduce you to Retiro, the sophisticated typeface of its time.</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>When any creative brief is assigned, it is essential to read the project details with the utmost attention. Once you have a thorough understanding of your project, it is time to do research. For this assignment, I first started by experimenting with the typeface to generate layout and design ideas. Through experimenting, I discovered that the y glyph resembles a wine or martini glass. This results in the underlying theme of a luxury menu throughout the poster design.</p>

        <h2>Rationale</h2>
        <p>The colour combinations of green and greys create an appearance of elegance and solidity. The olive green contributes to the cocktail menu idea behind the design. By putting y glyphs next to each other, it creates an illusion of a drink tray. This interactive feature catches the eye and allows for the imagination to come into play. The details throughout this poster speak to the unique characteristics of the modern typeface, Retiro.</p>
